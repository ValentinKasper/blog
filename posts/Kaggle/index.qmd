# What is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)?

Kaggle is an online platform that hosts data science and machine learning competitions. It was founded in 2010 and later acquired by Google in 2017. Kaggle provides a comprehensive environment for data scientists and machine learning practitioners to access a wide variety of datasets, run and share data analysis and modeling code, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

Here are some key features of Kaggle:

1. **Competitions**: Kaggle is well-known for its competitions, where organizations and researchers post data and problems, ranging from predictive modeling to analytics challenges. Participants can submit solutions and are ranked on a leaderboard based on their model’s performance. Competitions often come with cash prizes and can range from beginner to expert level.

2. **Datasets**: Kaggle hosts a large repository of datasets uploaded by users and organizations. These datasets can be used for personal projects, educational purposes, or to enter Kaggle’s own competitions. The datasets cover a wide range of domains, including economics, biology, and film industry analytics.

3. **Kernels**: Kernels are code notebooks on Kaggle that allow users to write, run, and share Python and R code. They provide an integrated environment based on Jupyter Notebooks, which supports data analysis and machine learning in an interactive, web-based format. Kernels can be public for community sharing or private for personal use.

4. **Courses**: Kaggle also offers free "Micro-Courses" that cover various data science and machine learning topics. These courses are designed to teach skills such as Python programming, machine learning, deep learning, data visualization, and more.

5. **Discussion Forums**: Kaggle includes forums where users can discuss data science topics, share insights, ask questions, and collaborate with each other. These forums are a valuable resource for learning and getting help from the community.

6. **Public API**: Kaggle provides a public API that allows users to interact with Kaggle's features programmatically, enabling tasks such as downloading datasets, managing kernels, and participating in competitions.
