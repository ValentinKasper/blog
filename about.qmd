<div align="justify">
I received my Ph.D. in Physics at the Universität Heidelberg in Germany and spent two years at Harvard University as a condensed matter theory group postdoctoral researcher. Until January 2020, I was a Marie-Skłodowska-Curie-fellow at the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO). Starting in 2021, I got a LaCaixa junior leader fellowship, allowing me to build a junior group at ICFO. Since 2022, I have offered my services as a consultant for quantum computation companies.  

My research and work focus on numerically simulating quantum many-body systems and designing  quantum simulation or computation. I am particularly interested in ions, neutral atoms, and solid-state systems for quantum information processing. In my research, I designed analog quantum simulators o understand better high-energy physics and condensed matter systems. For a list of my publications see my google scholar profile.

Personal Life:
I love mountaineering, music and reading.
